I'm Jacob Brooks, a software engineer and engineering manager living in Napa, California with my partner Kaitlin and our son Rory. I spend my days thinking about AI-assisted software development and helping teams learn to build better software, and my evenings playing video games, playing board games, working on my golf game, and exploring the mountains on skis.

I love exploring how new tools transform the way we work, tinkering with home automation projects, and getting lost in games - both analog and digital. This blog is where I share trip reports, side projects, and thoughts on whatever I'm currently obsessed with.
