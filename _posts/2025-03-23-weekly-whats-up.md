# What I'm reading
On [recommendation from Cody Townsend](https://www.thefiftyplus.pro/on-mountain-books/), I checked out [The Color of Everything](https://www.coryrichards.com/the-color-of-everything) from the library and read it over the course of a week or so. This is not my normal type of book (autobiography, verbose/flowery language, focus on mental health and trauma) but I thoroughly enjoyed it. He is a very talented writer, and holds nothing back about the challenges he's faced in life. Well, I think so - it's easy to forget with books like this that no matter how honest the author seems, you _are_ getting a very specific perspective. I do think he's being honest! He certainly doesn't portray himself in a great light. But it's still his perspective, everyone's own view is skewed. I guess it doesn't really matter, I don't know this person and my judgement of them means nothing. But it's probably good to recognize the psychological trick you play on yourself when you implicitly trust/take someone's side because of how honest they seem by placing themself in a negative light.

Rambling on perspective and trust aside, whole-heartedly recommend this book to mountain adventurers or anyone who enjoys a thoughtful, introspective story.

# What I'm playing
- 12ish hours into [Avowed](https://avowed.obsidian.net/) and enjoying it very much. Probably the first first-person RPG game like this I've enjoyed since... Outer Worlds? The combat feels great, the writing is good, and I like the setting - same as the Pillars of Eternity CRPGS. Will be picking away at this for a while, don't have as much time to sink into long games as I used to.

# What I'm watching
- Kaitlin and I saw [Black Bag](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt30988739/) this weekend and both liked it. Two great stars, an enticing mystery, adult drama, and a tight 93 minutes. More movies like this please!

# What I'm listening to
- The [Lane 8 2025 Spring Mixtape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqyavr1B5GA), it's officially Spring!
