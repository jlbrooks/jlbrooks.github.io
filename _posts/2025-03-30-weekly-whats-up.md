# What I'm playing
- We're five games into [Ticket to Ride: Legends of the West](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/390092/ticket-to-ride-legacy-legends-of-the-west) and loving it. Some new little wrinkle every game, and they're gradually getting longer. Hoping it doesn't start to drag by the time we get to the last few.

# What I'm watching
- We watched [Punch-Drunk Love](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272338/) this week, what a lovely film. The score was compelling, percussion driving the plot forward and harmonizing with Adam Sandler and his harpsichord. Honing in on the score sent us down a rabbit hole - [John Brion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Brion) was familiar to my dad from his fandom of The Grays in the early 90s. Going to explore more of his and Paul Thomas Anderson's work.
