# What I'm reading
- After re-reading all of the Stormlight Archive in preparation for [Wind and Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/203578847-wind-and-truth) I read [Warbreaker](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1268479.Warbreaker) for the first time. It was delightful, and now likely in my top 5 Sanderson books. I hope he gets to write the sequel someday.
- I'm slowly working my way through [[The Absorbent Mind]](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CBDC1U6), one chapter at a time each Rory feeding. More to say on this when I finish.

# What I'm playing
- I dove back into [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/) after the 1.0 update and sunk too many hours into a new save. These factory games scratch an itch that I get less of in my day-to-day work these days.
- [Metaphor ReFantazio](https://metaphor.atlus.com/index.html?lang=en) is a surprise hit any may end up being my GOTY. I would not call myself a JRPG/Atlus fan, having only played 15 hours or so of Persona 3 Reload earlier this year. This one has me hooked though, and is the most fun I've had with an RPG since Baldur's gate 3.

# What I'm up to
- We spent the weekend at Tahoe and took a nice hike with Rory up past [Eagle lake](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/eagle-lake-trail--4). Great to be in the mountains again, I'm ready for winter!
