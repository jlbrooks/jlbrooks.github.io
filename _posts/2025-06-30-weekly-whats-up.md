# What I'm reading
- [How long contexts fail](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html) and [How to fix your context](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/26/how-to-fix-your-context.html) from Drew Bruenig were both good. There is so much craft involved in making AI agents work well, it's very exciting to watch this field progress.

# What I'm playing
- I finished Death Stranding. In awe of how all of the pieces come together and form an inspiring and beautiful whole. The gameplay is odd and the story is a convoluted mess at times but once you are immersed it works. The music is a big part of what kept me going, the high of cresting a mountain and the sound fading out to an ethereal track from [Low Roar](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/low-roar/475538413) had me schlepping boxes across up and down the continent. My game of the (other) year so far, beyond excited to start the newly-release sequel.

# What I'm listening to
- Discovered from the Death Stranding soundtrack, exploring Low Roar's discography. Really like [Once in a Long, Long While](https://music.apple.com/us/album/once-in-a-long-long-while/1641207325)
