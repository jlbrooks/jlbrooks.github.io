# What I'm watching
A quick trip to the East coast for a wedding meant I had ~8 hours of movie watching, a rare occurrence:
- I spent the entire first flight and part of the second with the delightful double feature of [A complete Unknown](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11563598/) and [No Direction Home](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367555/). I did not know much about Bob Dylan... and now I do! It's remarkable what he was able to do at a young age, and how he was able to break away from the folk movement. A true contrarian, through and through.
- I watched [Citizen Kane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033467/) for the first time. No idea what to expect, but I found it immensely watchable and gripping as the plot unfolded. Orson Welles is magnetic!
