# What I'm reading
- [Play Nice](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725429/) from Jason Schreier chronicles the history of Blizzard entertainment. I have a long history with Blizzard games (playing Warcraft II before I could read!) and so far it's a great behind-the-scenes look at the evolution of the company.

# What I'm playing
- I _wish_ I was still working through Metaphor ReFantazio (I'll get back to it eventually!) but I've been nerd sniped by [Factorio: Space Age](https://factorio.com/blog/post/factorio-space-age-release). I've been anticipating this release and when it dropped on Monday I started a new save thinking "I'll just get my starter base going and come back later". 25 hours later I'm stranded on Fulgora working to set up a recycler network. It's a blast!

# What I'm up to
- I connected the heat pump in Kaitlin's office to Home Assistant. Details here: [Controlling our heat pump with home assistant]({{ '/2024-10-27-heat-pump-home-assistant' | relative_url }})

# What Rory is doing
- He's *great* at rolling from his back to his stomach. I'll turn away for a few minutes and he'll have flipped himself. What's odd is that he... can't seem to get back to his back? Apparently babies are supposed to do this in the opposite order - first learning to go from tummy to back, then the other way. We'll be practicing and encouraging a lot this week.
