# What I'm watching
- We finished Andor season 2 and followed it up with Rogue One. Andor delivered, absolutely peak TV and peak Star Wars. Rogue one holds up pretty well, but is lacking in comparison to Andor. Too much fan service, not enough focus. Would love an "Andor cut" of Rogue one.

# What I'm listening to
- Vibing to this cover of  [Harvest Moon](https://music.apple.com/us/album/harvest-moon/1216384091?i=1216384317).

# What Rory is doing
- Walking a lot! As with most of his other developmental milestones so far, it's been incredible how quickly he develops skills once the switch is flipped and he takes on a new challenge.
