# What I'm reading
- Finished book two of the [Malazan Book of the Fallen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen) series and on to book three. Loving it, truly epic fantasy and you can feel the roots in a long RPG campaign. There's a depth of lore and mystery to the world that can be difficult to penetrate but very rewarding when things fall into place.

# What I'm playing
Two games are splitting my time right now:
- [Blue Prince](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/) deserves the hype, it's so so good. I don't know how the developer managed to make a puzzle-oriented drafting game this tight - there must have been so many iterations of this that were straight up unfair and unfun. I'm at the point in the game where I see the pathway to _an_ ending (probably rolling credits? I think?), I hope that it doesn't drag on. This is a tough juncture in games where much of the joy comes from disovery - once you see the road how much effort do you put in to get there?
- [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/). Continuing to dip my toes into turn-based RPGs, this feels great so far. The combat is complex from the get-go (no mindless simple grinding!) and I like the reacting timing. Connected to and invested in the characters already as well, excited to see more of this world.

# What Rory is doing
- He had his first birthday today. Not too interested in smashing his cake, but a big fan of all of the new toys. Very much into the "bang things on the table and throw them" phase.
