# What I'm playing
- Finally downloaded Balatro on my phone and... I'm hooked again.
- Visited our local game store and picked up the [Arkham Horror living card game](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205637/arkham-horror-the-card-game). Played the first scenario twice already and loving it. Looking forward to some of the campaign progression and deck building.

# What I'm watching
- Mentioned previously but I finished the [Half-Life 2 documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4). Strong recommend if you enjoyed these games or have any interest in game development.

# What I'm up to
- My ski season started yesterday with a lovely tour up to Mount Judah. More info here: [Mt. Judah ski tour]({{ '/2024-12-01-judah-ski-tour' | relative_url }})
