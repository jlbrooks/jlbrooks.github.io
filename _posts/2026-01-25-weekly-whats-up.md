## What I'm reading
Re-reading [The Golden Compass](https://www.amazon.com/Golden-Compass-Dark-Materials-Book/dp/0345413350) for the first time since I was a child. Spurred by learning (h/t [Triple Click](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/triple-click/)) that Pullman finished the follow-up trilogy [The Book of Dust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Dust) in October of last year. It's just as weird as I remember it, looking forward to digging back in.

## What I'm up to
I _hope_ to have solved my ski boot problem in the most brute-force way: buying new boots. Had a great experience at Olympic Boot Works this morning - the fitter immediately recognized my issue with forefoot pain in the current boots and put me in a new pair ([Technica Cochise 120](https://www.blizzard-tecnica.com/us/en/collection/men/ski-boots/cochise/cochise-120-dyn-gw-2)) that felt better with a stock fit than I've felt in boots in years. Fingers crossed, will find out next weekend.

## What I'm writing
I wrote up my [2026-01-25 2026 theme, objectives, and key results]({{ '/2026-01-25-2026-theme-objectives-and-key-results/' | relative_url }})

## What Rory is doing
He is more fun to interact with than ever, but starting to be more challenging than ever. Making his will known; little breakdowns are regular every mealtime when he doesn't get exactly what he wants. Hardest part: Not laughing when he scoops food off his plate and dumps it on the ground while looking you in the eye.
