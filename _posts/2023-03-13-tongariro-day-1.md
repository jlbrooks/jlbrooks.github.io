Today was a bit of a rest day for us, with nothing planned other than a drive down to our next stay at the [Tongariro Lodge](https://www.tongarirolodge.co.nz). Just outside of Taupo we stopped at the [Huka Falls](https://www.newzealand.com/int/feature/huka-falls/) to stretch our legs and take in the rushing water.

We wandered around downtown Taupo for a bit. We passed a "hole-in-one challenge" on the waterfront that I just couldn't pass up!

We stopped at a grocery store to pick up provisions for our hike tomorrow before driving down to the south end of the lake to our lodging. Walking along the river and wandering the lodge we were kicking ourselves for not booking a fishing trip, but I guess that's another reason to come back!

A quiet night will have us well rested for my most-anticipated activity of the trip: The Tongariro Crossing.
