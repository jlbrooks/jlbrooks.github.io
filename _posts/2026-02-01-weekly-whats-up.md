## What I'm reading
Working through [Machines of Loving Grace](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace) and the follow-up [The Adolescence of Technology](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology). It's rare to get this kind of writing from the leader of one of the (5? 3?) most important companies on Earth and I deeply respect it.

## What I'm watching
Nothing! I don't remember the last TV show I watched all the way through, probably Andor season 2? I'm not unhappy about it, but would like to watch more movies. Need to make time for this.

## What I'm up to
I got [Specmark](https://specmark.dev) to a place that I'm happy with and wrote about it here: [Specmark: annotating markdown specs for AI feedback]({{ '/2026-02-01-launching-specmark/' | relative_url }}). Fun process, learned a lot about end-to-end AI-driven development.
