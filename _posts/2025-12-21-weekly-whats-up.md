Wow, 6 weeks since the last update! Not quite a weekly update, hope to get back into a rhythm now that we're settled into our new (old) house.

# What I'm reading
- Started [Too Like the Lightning](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114545-too-like-the-lightning) - very unique so far. Have heard it compared to Neal Stephenson's Baroque cycle so excited to get further in.

# What I'm playing
- [Sektori](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2105620/Sektori/) has its claws in me, such a fun loop but so hard! Recommendation: Don't look anything up, it intentionally does not tell you very much about the mechanics of scoring and that discovery is a part of the fun.

# What I'm watching
- We continued our Paul Thomas Anderson kick with [Boogie Nights](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118749/). So good, probably my favorite so far. Read the [Grantland Oral History](https://grantland.com/features/boogie-nights/) after watching!

# What I'm up to
- Moving back in means lots of projects! Heavy-duty floating shelves in my office vexed me for a bit, learnings: Don't use the drywall anchors that come with shelves, and really don't use drywall anchors. Just find the studs. 

# What Rory is doing
- Talking, moving, talking. Feels like he's getting a new word every day, super exciting to see this progress after not having much to say.
