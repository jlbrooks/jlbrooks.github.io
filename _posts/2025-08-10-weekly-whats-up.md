# What I'm watching
- We went to see the new [Naked Gun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3402138/) movie last night after watching [the original](https://www.imdb.com/video/vi3084976409/ ) the night before. The original is very silly and not quite as good as *Airplane!* (what comedy is?) but enjoyable overall. We both enjoyed the remake! It does not lean on references or callbacks to the original series, just launches 10 jokes/minute at you and hopes that you laugh. We did, along with the rest of the theatre. Great to have a true silly comedy out there again, I hope that we get more like this.

# What I'm listening to
- [Welcome,Interstate Managers](https://music.apple.com/us/album/welcome-interstate-managers/712721721) from Fountains of Wayne has been in heavy rotation for Kaitlin and I. So many good songs outside of Stacy's Mom (which is a great song!). , *Bright future in Sales*, *Hackensack*, and *Valley winter song* are my favorites.

# What I'm up to
- We [went to Bend]({{ '/2025-08-09-weekend-in-bend/' | relative_url }}) last weekend to visit with friends. Lovely trip, we will certainly return as a family and stay for longer.
