# What I'm reading
- Re-reading the training plan sections of [Training for the uphill athlete](https://uphillathlete.com/product/training-for-the-uphill-athlete-book/). I signed up for the [Broken Arrow Skyrace 23K](https://www.brokenarrowskyrace.com/23k) and have some work to do over the next 6 months to prepare.

# What I'm watching
- Kaitlin and I watched [Conclave](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt20215234/). Great cast, great performances, good drama, but not sure I love how they wrapped the plot up.

# What I'm listening to
- Apple's end-of-year review came out so I'm revisiting some of my top listens from earlier this year. PRAANA's [Supernal Dawn](https://music.apple.com/us/album/supernal-dawn/1709497296) had the top spot!
