Yeesh, it's been a while! Not so much of a "weekly", will try to get back to a regular rhythm.

# What I'm reading
- Started and finished [Gardens of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardens_of_the_Moon). As I started it and found the first chapter familiar I realized that I had tried to read it at some point in the past and bounced off it. I persevered this time and am thrilled that I did - the worldbuilding is fantastic and characters very well written. I learned while reading that it is based off a GURPS rpg world created by the author, totally unsurprising. This is the kind of fantasy book that has me itching to pull my sourcebooks off of the shelf.

# What I'm playing
- Still chugging through the delightful Astrobot
- Played a few hours of [Metroid Zero Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroid:_Zero_Mission) on my flight to Austin. Very impressed by what they were able to do in this package, and very cool to see the lineage of games that I love present here.

# What I'm listening to
- The song [Black Day](https://music.apple.com/us/album/black-day/1493969293?i=1493969299) by Monolink played post-album and hooked me immediately. Enjoying the album Amniotic and going to dig further into their discography.

# What I'm up to
- One reason for fewer posts - we have moved out of our house and into my parents! This marks the start of a long renovation project. Already can't wait for it to be done.
