We spent the last week in Western New York on Keuka Lake, my favorite place in the world.It was Rory's 2nd visit, but he was mostly a potato last year so this time was his first true lake experience.

It was an unseasonably cool end of August so not much time hanging out in the water, but throwing rocks and splashing around the edge was still a lot of fun for him.

We got out for a couple of rounds of golf - one at Lakeside, and one at Ravenwood, a new course and one that my dad would be playing a tournament at the next week.

A highlight for Rory on a warm day towards the end of the trip: Canoeing and kayaking!

Lake activities aside, the real reason this place is special is seeing family. I hope to instill in Rory as he gets older the importance of this place and connections to our far-flung family.
