# What I'm reading
- Picking away at the [Claude 4 system card](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/4263b940cabb546aa0e3283f35b686f4f3b2ff47.pdf). Don't have a ton of experience with the new models yet but in general Claude has been my go-to for software.

# What I'm playing
- Rolled credits on [Blue Prince](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/) t for the first time this weekend. Very rewarding experience, and once I saw the path to the end it wasn't a slog to get there. 15 hours to get here, and I'd guess I could easily spend 50+ more trying to uncover all of the secrets. Will play a big more but not sure how deep I'll go.

# What I'm up to
- Playing a lot of golf. Competitive 36 hole event at my club last weekend, Wednesday evening beer league the past few weeks, 9 hole evening rounds with Rory. Continually tweaking the swing but have found what feels like a good move - 90 feels like the ceiling for my game now.

# What I'm writing
- Some cousins are visiting Napa later this year so I put together a public page with recommendations. Will try to keep this updated: [Visiting Napa](https://jlbrooks.tech/napa/).
