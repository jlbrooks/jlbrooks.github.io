# What I'm reading
- I finished [[Play Nice]](https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jason-schreier/play-nice/9781538725429/). A must-read if you are a fan of Blizzard games, and a great read if you have any interest in business of making video games. It's a great look into how a company grows up (or doesn't!) over 30 years.
- I'm always reading Matt Levine's [Money Stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/money-stuff) newsletter. I've learned so much from reading his work every weekday for the past couple of years; it's kicked off an interest in the financial industry in general. This week, though I read Gwern's article [Why so few Matt Levines?](https://gwern.net/matt-levine) that offered some interesting perspective on why Matt is so successful.

# What I'm playing
- Kaitlin and I are a few scenarios into [Frosthaven](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/295770/frosthaven) with our friends Mitch and Alli. Not far enough in to judge the outpost building mechanics yet but the scenarios are as good as ever. Playing on Tabletop Simulator via the Frosthaven Enhanced mod, the virtual tabletop really shines for this game. We played Gloomhaven in person years back and the 45 minute setup was a real drag.

# What I'm watching
- Red zone! I'm in a fantasy football league this year with some high school friends and it has me more engaged in NFL football than I have been in 10 years. Red Zone is peak American sports coverage, pure content and adrenaline for 7 hours straight every Sunday. It's beautiful!
