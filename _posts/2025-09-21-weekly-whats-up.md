# What I'm reading
- [Class Dismissed](https://joincolossus.com/article/joe-liemandt-class-dismissed/) is another peek into the nexus of alternative education swirling around Austin, Texas.

# What I'm playing
- [Hollow Knight: Silksong](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/) is out and it's incredible. I'm pretty bad and it's hard, we'll see how far I get.

# What I'm watching
- We're a few episodes into [The Paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paper_(2025_TV_series)) and it's surprisingly good. Captures the spirit of the office without being referential and we like the characters so far.

# What I'm listening to
- Chris Plant's [Post Games](https://postgame.substack.com/) podcast is rising in my podcast list and fills a nice niche in the videogame podcast space. Favorite episodes so far have been the [discussion on AI](https://postgame.substack.com/p/what-we-have-in-common-with-world) and the [interview with the creator of Blippo](https://postgame.substack.com/p/can-you-fit-cable-tv-into-a-video) (looking forward to playing this with Kaitlin when it is released this week!).

# What I'm up to
- A few weeks late, but [we went to Keuka lake]({{ '/2025-09-04-keuka-2025/' | relative_url }}) to visit family and spend time at my favorite place in the world.
