# What I'm reading
- The [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) prediction. Still reading the appendices and processing to write a bit about this, but I think that everyone should read it. You may find the prediction unrealistic, but the process of determining your specific points of disagreement will be a valuable one. Even if we don't see the 2027 predicted, the case outlined for 2025 is much more likely (though maybe delayed a few years) and has a drastic impact on how we approach knowledge work today.

# What I'm playing
- I finished Astro Bot. Not revolutionary but a delightful experience all the way through, strongly recommend to anyone who enjoys platformers. I'm no expert but I did find myself missing the technical depth of the 3D Mario games in the base platforming - even Super Mario 64 gave you more tools to use creatively. They make up for this in Astro Bot by giving you fun special toy powers on every level, but there's still something missing from the experience.

# What I'm listening to
- Odd lots is a must-listen through all of the turmoil. Looking forward to many tariff-related supply chain episodes.

# What I'm up to
- Spending too much time watching markets and thinking about trading. I've made some money over the past couple of weeks on the thesis "The markets aren't taking Trump seriously enough". Hitting on a couple of these bets has given me a direct exposure to the gamblers mentality, immediately was thinking "well if I'd sized this trade 10x bigger I'd have made $xxx more". Need to keep that in check!
