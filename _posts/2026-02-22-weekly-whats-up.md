## What I'm reading
[Child's Play](https://harpers.org/archive/2026/03/childs-play-sam-kriss-ai-startup-roy-lee/) was a fun read. Watching the Donald Boat saga unfold in real time was surreal and this was a good retelling. Author is pessimistic on AI (which authors in this milieu aren't?), but overall a good examination of viral marketing culture.

>In a way, Donald Boat had achieved the dream of every desperate startup founder in the Bay Area. He had propelled himself to online fame, and used it to relieve major investors of their money. But somehow he'd managed to do it without ever once having to create a B2B app. He was a kind of pure viral phenomenon.

## What I'm playing
Still playing Cairn, though it can be throw-your-controller frustrating. Lost ~30 minutes of progress last night, brutal! Writing that, though, makes me think I've gone soft - 20 years ago I think that'd be a common occasion?

## What I'm writing
I wrote up our ski trip: [Idaho ski trip]({{ '/2026-02-21-idaho-ski-trip/' | relative_url }}).
