# What I'm playing
- I brought [Ethnos](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/206718/ethnos) to the table at our weekly board game night and was reminded what a solid simple Euro this is. Need to play more!

# What I'm watching
- Winter is approaching (or here?) and I'm getting ready for ski season. Cody Townsend's new [Fifty-plus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Id6u72EK4oU) series is providing the stoke.

# What I'm listening to
- I'm a semi-regular [Odd Lots](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/odd-lots/id1056200096) listener, and thoroughly enjoyed their recent 3-part [Beak capitalism](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/beak-capitalism-part-1-chickflation/id1056200096?i=1000677062052) series. A break from their usual interview format, this is a produced deep-dive into the markets and forces behind the poultry industry in America. Warning - frank discussion of the grim reality of large-scale factory farming.
	- Since I'm mentioning Odd Lots, I have to bring up their [2021 show with Matt Levine and Sam Bankman-Fried](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sam-bankman-fried-and-matt-levine-on-how-the/id1056200096?i=1000531062191). This was insane when it first aired ("I make a token out of a box that does nothing, and we all make money") and is a great re-listen after everything that happened with FTX.

# What Rory is doing
- We're working on drinking out of a real (glass!) cup. Today we got two hands and his mouth on the rim. Baby steps!
