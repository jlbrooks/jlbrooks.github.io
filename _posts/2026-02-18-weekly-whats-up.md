## What I'm reading
Finished [The Adolescence of Technology](https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology). There are many possible readings of a piece like this from someone in Dario's position, but my belief (70%?) is that it is genuine. Naive, maybe - it does feel good to believe that someone in power is thinking seriously about the risks of what is coming.

## What I'm playing
Started [Cairn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/) on the way to Idaho, very impressive. Probably the best climbing mechanics I've played with, it is challenging and feels realistic but is fairly natural to control.

## What I'm watching
We blazed through the first five episodes of [A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27497448/) in one evening. Great stuff, reminds me how good Game of Thrones can be. Maybe I should watch House of the Dragon? Whenever GRRM gets the next book out I'm looking forward to a re-read of the series.

## What I'm up to
We went to McCall, Idaho for the weekend to ski with Kincaid and Ellie at a couple of small resorts. Fun small town, nice to have a couple of days to ski and relax but we missed Rory! Won't leave for that long again for a while.
