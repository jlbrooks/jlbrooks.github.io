## What I'm reading
- [I hate fish](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/i-hate-fish/) from Rand's resonated deeply in my bones. I am feeling in a rut with my Omnifocus-driven productivity system, and likely going to try and re-think from (my own) first principles and vibe-code something else in the next few months.
- [How Food Delivery Is Reshaping Mealtime](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/dining/food-delivery-apps-doordash-uber.html) was painful to read. I thankfully still have a visceral distaste for DoorDash/etc. and try to avoid it. We usually use it when hosting friends/family which feels more economical.

## What I'm watching
Catching up on season 2 of Cody Townsend's [Fifty+](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSj-6RsDycxnh7rkC-usIKDPqiEZm70gB) series to build the stoke for some upcoming skiing. Best adventure-skiing content out there!
