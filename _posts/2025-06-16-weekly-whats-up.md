# What I'm playing
- Years late, trying to get into [Death Stranding](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/). I think I might be hooked! The gameplay is odd but strangely addicting. The story is bonkers, I need to play more just to understand what the heck is going on.

# What I'm watching
- Karpathy's talk last week was very good: [Software is Changing (Again)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ)

# What I'm up to
- Playing a lot of golf - 63 holes this week! Shot a personal-best 81 twice. Practice priorities moving forward are straightening and lengthening the driver, figuring out my wedge matrix, and cleaning up the short game a bit. Need to start converting more up-and-downs.
