On Thursday Kaitlin and I embarked on our long-awaited honeymoon (can we call it a honeymoon 2.5 years late?) to New Zealand. We'll be spending 13 days total in the country, visiting Auckland, Queenstown, Rotorua, and Tongariro. Our journey began with a 13 hour overnight flight from SFO-Auckland - surpisingly easy for me, I feel like I've had worse times on 6 hour redeyes across the country.

# Day 1 - Saturday

After landing around 9:30am, collecting our bags, and braving the strict customs (we had to declare our hiking boots!) we picked up our rental car and made the 40 minute drive to our hotel in the city center. We had a tentative plan to take the ferry to Davenport that afternoon, but arrived in the city a bit later than expected and did not want to cut it too close to our dinner reservation. We opted instead for a glass of wine and snack in the ferry building.

The highlight of the day and a true transition to vacation mode was our dinner at [Cazador](https://cazador.co.nz/restaurant). We opted to splurge on both the 13 course "feast" meal and the beverage pairing.
