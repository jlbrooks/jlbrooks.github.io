# What I'm playing
- Kaitlin, Aike and I played [Trails](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/338628/trails) at our weekly boardgame get-together. We like it more than Parks - similar theme and great art, but faster and more engaging.

# What I'm watching
- Not current, but earlier this year Kaitlin and I watched [Hundreds of Beavers](https://www.hundredsofbeavers.com/). I don't really have words to describe it... Loony-tunes-esque, Buster Keaton inspired black-and-white silent musical slapstick comedy? It's the funniest movie I've seen in years, strong recommend. There are limited showings in theaters this December, go and see it!

# What I'm up to
Thinking about the recent election results. Trying to avoid going down paths of "what the Democrats should do differently", because it feels navel-gazey - I'm not a strategist, I'm not a pundit, I'm not involved in politics. What does my opinion on such things matter past intellectual curiousity?

I am, though, trying to write down some thoughts on how things feel right now and what I predict will happen over the next few years. We (humans) are very good at rationalizing and updating beliefs post-hoc, _usually_ in a way that paints ourselves in a positive light. "Yes, of course I knew that Trump wasn't _really_ going to enact 30% tariffs across the board. That was just a negotiating tactic". Hoping that capturing some of these beliefs and reasonings now will help future me think about processing the world.
