# What I'm reading
- Good stuff on AI engineering right now:Â [Just Talk to it](https://steipete.me/posts/just-talk-to-it).  This aligns with experiences we've had at work (re-writing a big internal API pretty much 100% using Claude Code). The graph at the start of the article rings very true.

# What I'm playing
- Bouncing back and forth between Silksong and Hades 2. Both challenging but the contrast between just hitting your head against a wall in Silksong and the slow natural progression of Hades is neat - nice to bounce back and forth.
- Got a 2 player game of Ark Nova in with my Dad. Hadn't played in a couple years and was reminded how much I liked it. Great with two players, would only play it with 3 or fewer and with everyone familiar + focused to keep it moving.

# What Rory is doing
- Babbling, babbling, trying to talk. Official word count is up to 6ish, with some words meaning _many_ things. Mama = mom, more, that, give me that, food, etc.
