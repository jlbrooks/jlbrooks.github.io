# What I'm playing
- Two 9-hole rounds of golf this weekend, it's nice to be playing again. Always something to work on. Looking forward to more evening rounds (possibly with the baby?) with the daylight lasting longer into the evening.

# What Rory is doing
- He's sick! He brought some little bug home his first week of daycare in January, but this is a real-deal virus. Vomit, diarrhea, fever, the works. His fever hit 104.5 yesterday and we earned our "unnecessary trip to the hospital" parenting badge. My learning: Fever itself was a bad number, but not worthy of concern given what we already knew. Next time, give Tylenol and look for other signs of distress or the fever not coming down before escalating to a Dr. visit.
