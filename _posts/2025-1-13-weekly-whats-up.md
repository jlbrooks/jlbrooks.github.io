# What I'm listening to
- I listened to [Dwarkesh interview Tyler Cowen](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tyler-cowen-the-1-bottleneck-to-ai-progress-is-humans/id1516093381?i=1000683347383) on AI progress and other things. First half of the conversation was more interesting, quote that stuck with me (paraphrased): "Intelligence is not the bottleneck to clean water and electricity in Sub-Saharan Africa!". Folks in white-collar knowledge professions are probably overestimating the immediate impact of AI.

# What I'm up to
- Hiking and running, getting back into a regular training plan routine. Ramping up to the start of my base progression, which will be 16 miles and 4000 vertical feet/week.
