Earlier this year we learned about the [Shasta Ski park backcountry cabins](https://www.skipark.com/backcountry) and were quickly convinced that we should go visit. We rounded up 7 total people to fill up the cabin and booked it for one night on April 15, optimistic about the strong snowpack this winter.

Two early starts from Napa and Bend had us at the resort a bit after 9, and by 10:30 we were on our way. Ozzie, our host, gave us a quick overview in the office before joining us on the 3 chairlift rides and subsequent ski down into the valley that separates the resort from the cabins.

We transitioned and hiked for a short mile and a half on a cat track before arriving at the cabins. Ozzie left us halfway through the hike having gone above and beyond what we expected of him (though I suspect he enjoyed the excuse to get out and do some skiing on his own).
