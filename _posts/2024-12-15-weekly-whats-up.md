# What I'm reading
- [Debanking and debunking](https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/debanking-and-debunking/) is another great one from Patrick McKenzie. Having an understanding of how systems like this (and how to be a [dangerous professional](https://x.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768)) is a skill that most people don't think about developing.
- I will finish [Wind and Truth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203578847-wind-and-truth) tonight. Sanderson's work isn't revolutionary literature or prose but his worldbuilding is second-to-none.

# What I'm playing
- I finally rolled credits on Metaphor ReFantazio, and wrote about it here: [You should play Metaphor ReFantazio]({{ '/2024-12-15-you-should-play-metaphor-refantazio' | relative_url }}). Taking a breather from RPGs like this but I think that Persona 5 or Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth are in my future.
