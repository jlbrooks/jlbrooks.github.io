# What I'm up to
Early stages of setting up a personal assistant via [Clawdis](https://clawd.bot/). Goal is to have something connected to calendars, tasks, email, Dropbox/Obsidian, with some web search capability for Kaitlin and I to use together. I'm sure that there will be products (maybe from the major model providers) like this soon, but I'm a big fan of self-hosting something like this.

# What Rory is doing
Getting much more dextrous, going very fast on his bike and tossing a ball back and forth for ~5 turns. Super fun, glimpse of what is to come!
