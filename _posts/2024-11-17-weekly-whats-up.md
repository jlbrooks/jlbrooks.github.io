# What I'm reading
- [A sensitive period for texting](https://higherground.substack.com/p/friday-note-a-sensitive-period-for). Neat perspective on technology use for children and something I cannot wait to try out when Rory is old enough.

# What I'm playing
- A few boardgames this week with Dad and his gaming crew:
	- Race for the Galaxy and Jump Drive are as good as they've always been. Need to play more Jump Drive!
	- 5 player game of Root. Also still quite good, first time playing with the Riverfolk. Very good theme+mechanics tie-in, they are offering cards for sale and setting prices every turn.
- Dipping into the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 single player campaign and it's... actually pretty good! Engaging spy thriller story with a good variety of missions so far.

# What I'm watching
- The Half Life 2 anniversary announcement this week reminded me that I never got around to watching the [Half Life documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbZ3HzvFEto). So good, these games were formative for me as a child and represented truly impressive leaps forward in video games. [Half Life 2 documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4) on deck for this week.
