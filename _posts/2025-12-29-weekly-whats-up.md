# What I'm reading
A couple of good articles on agentic coding:
- [My experience with Claude code 2.0](https://sankalp.bearblog.dev/my-experience-with-claude-code-20-and-how-to-get-better-at-using-coding-agents/). Pretty good overview, nothing too revolutionary here but a great starting point if you haven't been following Claude Code throughout the year.
- [Shipping at Inference-Speed](https://steipete.me/posts/2025/shipping-at-inference-speed). One for the Codex-heads! I like the emphasis on simplicity, I do feel validated not going all-in on the skills/plugins/etc. hype ("30 sub-agents to run your business"). The model capabilities and harness catch up quick! Will be working Codex more into my personal projects.

# What I'm playing
Some boardgames! Need to get back into this habit and make more time regularly. Burndown through my collection in 2026 is a goal. Recent plays of Patchwork and Tapestry with Kaitlin, and Terraforming Mars with my dad and Greg.

# What I'm up to
All-in on agentic coding over the holiday break. Currently working on a portfolio tracker, as nothing I've found _quite_ meets my needs. It's the era of personal software, baby!

Particularly fun has been coding from my phone. I set up an Ubuntu server box on my home lab, connected it and my phone to tailscale, and talk to Claude Code via Termius on my phone. I can ask it to make changes and see updates in real time to the app running on my local network.

Semi-related, I was frustrated trying to develop on my Windows machine with WSL - too many networking annoyances and little gotchas. I was debating buying a Mac Studio but had the thought "why not linux?". One afternoon later and my daily driver is [`Pop!_OS`](https://system76.com/pop/r) and I'm not looking back. Gaming was the main thing keeping me on Windows, but with Proton/Steam Deck development over the past few years Linux support has gotten extremely good. Is 2026 the year of the Linux Desktop?!?
