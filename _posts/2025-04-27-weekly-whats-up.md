# What I'm playing
- Kaitlin, Ellie and I played the first few missions of [Sunderfolk](https://www.dreamhaven.com/games/sunderfolk) last night and I'm very impressed so far. Very clear inspiration from Gloomhaven, and the control-with-your-phone idea is brilliant. Excited to get further into this, and I hope we see more games in this vein.

# What I'm watching
- Andor season 2! The only Star Wars media that I've consumed in the past couple of years.

# What I'm writing
- Thinking a lot about AI-assisted software development right now, I wrote some [Thoughts on teaching developers to embrace AI]({{ '/2025-04-27-thoughts-on-teaching-developers-to-embrace-ai' | relative_url }}).
