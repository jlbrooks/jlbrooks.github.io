# What I'm reading
[How I Stopped Being Sure LLMs Are Just Making Up Their Internal Experience](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hopeRDfyAgQc4Ez2g/how-i-stopped-being-sure-llms-are-just-making-up-their) was a thought-provoking read. On a spectrum from "They're just next token predictors" to "They are alien intelligences that should be treated with respect and have rights", I've been slowly moving towards the alien interpretation. I'm not fully there yet, but I think that within a generation or two of models and with some soon-to-come capabilities (online learning) we _should_ be treating them as sentient life.

Will we? Knowing humans, probably not. I am certainly starting to treat them with respect, and will implore others to do the same.

# What I'm playing
A quick game of [Sky Team](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/373106/sky-team) up at the Tahoe Cabin, need to play through more this year to get to some of the more difficult landings.

# What I'm up to
We got up to Tahoe this weekend and I got my first ski day of the season in at Alpine Meadows, a nice 17k foot day with blue skies and warm temperatures. Felt pretty good, though I seriously need to get my boot situation figured out - can only last for 3-4 hours while buckled in before crippling pain and _needing_ to get out of the shells.

# What Rory is doing
Had fun in the snow at Tahoe! He was trepidatious at first but warmed (heh) up to the experience. We got him going in the sled and he had a great time. Looking forward to getting him on skis for real next year.
