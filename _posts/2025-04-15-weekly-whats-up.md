# What I'm reading
- The [Mouseguard RPG](https://www.mouseguard.net/rpg) rule book. A boiled down subset of Burning Wheel with a lovely theme, I'd love to get this out sometime. Will I? Who knows, I certainly read RPG books more than I play them.

# What I'm watching
- The 2025 Masters was probably the greatest golf tournament I'll ever watch. Rory Mcilroy winning the Masters, breaking his 14 year major drought, and completing the career grand slam with a harrowing Sunday round full of the highest highs and the lowest lows? It doesn't get any better than that. In the same round he hit both one of the worst - the wedge into the water on 13 - and best - the hooking iron into 15 - golf shots you'll ever see in a major golf tournament. It's poetic, representative of his career, and I wouldn't have had it any other way.
