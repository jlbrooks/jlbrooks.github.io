# What I'm playing
- My dad and I are 4 turns into [Dien Bien Phu: The Final Gamble](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/94373/dien-bien-phu-the-final-gamble). Loving this so far, it captures the tension of the siege and the difficult path for both sides to victory. I'm playing as the Viet Minh, the division-level morale and trench zones are a cool thematic twist on familiar concepts from other wargames.

# What I'm listening to
- I'm working through my backlog of the [Age of Napoleon podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-age-of-napoleon-podcast/id1223795973). I just learned about the [Battle of Somosierra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Somosierra), where French forces took a severe mountain pass on the way to Madrid. The Polish regiment of the Imperial Guard led an astounding charge through four successive gun emplacements in the pass and single-handedly won the battle.

# What Rory is doing
- Crawling!! Well, inch-worming, but he is definitely mobile. Put something he wants out in front of him and he will move 6+ feet forward to get it. Time to baby-proof...
