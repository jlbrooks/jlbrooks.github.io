# What I'm reading
- I'm halfway through [When the Clock Broke: ## Con Men, Conspiracists, and How America Cracked Up in the Early 1990s](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374605445/whentheclockbroke/). Learning a lot of history from just before my time, and finding plenty of echoes that have reverberated back to today. Will have more to say once I'm done.

# What I'm playing
- After playing around with the Delta emulator on my iphone for the past 6 months I impulse-bought an [Anbernic RG35xxSP](https://anbernic.com/products/rg35xxsp?variant=45255733149953) (they got me with that price-point!). Flashed [Knulli](https://knulli.org/) onto it and I was off to the races. Currently playing: Mario Golf: Advance Tour, Advance Wars, and [Pokemon: Emerald Seaglass](https://pokemonemeraldseaglass.com/).

# What I'm up to
- I participated in the Shasta Ascension skimo race last weekend. I was hoping to beat my time from last year and finish in under 2 hours but came in right around 2:15. It was cold and windy, but sunny - an improvement over the sleet last year but led to some tough conditions on the uphill.
