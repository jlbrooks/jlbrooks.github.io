# What I'm reading
- I thought that [Reflections on OpenAI](https://calv.info/openai-reflections) was a cool insight into how the company works. I love this sort of thing; need more insight into the day-to-day of how other companies operate.
	- "There's a **strong bias to action** (you can just do things). It wasn't unusual for similar teams but unrelated teams to converge on various ideas. I started out working on a parallel (but internal) effort similar to [ChatGPT Connectors](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11487775-connectors-in-chatgpt). There must've been ~3-4 different [Codex](https://openai.com/index/introducing-codex/) prototypes floating around before we decided to push for a launch. These efforts are usually taken by a small handful of individuals without asking permission. Teams tend to quickly form around them as they show promise."
- [Introducing Kiro](https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro/) seems cool, I like the push towards a more opinionated editor that prescribes a particular workflow. I do wonder, though, how much of this sort of thing is built using the assumption of model capabilities today? What do our tools look like 1 year from now, is this sort of scaffolding necessary?

# What I'm playing
- Deep into Death Stranding 2. Gives you tools much faster than the first one, and the combat is wayyy more fleshed out. Very easy (maybe because I just played the first one?), but enjoying it nonetheless.

# What I'm watching
- Kaitlin and I watched [Burn After Reading](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887883/) last weekend and both enjoyed it. Kinda mean, very funny, classic Coen Brothers stuff. The conversation scenes with J.K. Simmons make the whole movie.
