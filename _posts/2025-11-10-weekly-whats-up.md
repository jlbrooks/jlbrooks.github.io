# What I'm reading
- Reading more of [Rand's leadership blog](https://randsinrepose.com/), [Become the Consequence](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/become-the-consequence/) was really good. Need to practice more of this! Picked up his "Art of Leadership" book, mostly a collection of essays from the blog but it seems like a good highlight reel.
- [The Hatred of Podcasting](https://thebaffler.com/outbursts/the-hatred-of-podcasting-belden) was pretty good.
	- "Of course, most aren’t actively listening to Fridman and Huberman for two hours at a time. The episodes are a layer of white noise, a way to blot out thoughts. Podcasts came of age amid the growing absence of meaningful contact in the average person’s day, in a time when silence is hated."

# What I'm playing
- More Ark Nova! Want to break out Terraforming Mars again to compare how they feel.

# What I'm watching
A long flight top India was good movie time.
- [Napoleon (2023)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13287846/) was... just ok. Not a fan of using Josephine as the sole lens to view the man, it felt pretty reductive.
- [Tenet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6723592/) was incredible!? I don't know how I didn't see this until now. Need to watch again.

Also watched [Poor Things](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14230458/) which was, uh, quite something. Interesting film about women's liberation, I think there's an essay to be written comparing to Barbie?

# What I'm up to
I traveled to India for work last week. Great to visit and meet people in person for the first time, cool to visit a country (and continent!) that I'd never been to before. Highlights: The food, Mughal forts in Jaipur, and the food.
