# What I'm reading
- 60% of the way through [If Anyone Builds it, Everyone Dies](https://www.amazon.com/Anyone-Builds-Everyone-Dies-Superhuman/dp/0316595640). Compelling in the same way that [AI 2027](https://ai-2027.com/) was, but requires a close reading and introspection to see where I might disagree. October will be 6 months since AI 2027 was published, I will try to do a reflection on both of those together in the next few weeks.

# What I'm playing
- [Peak](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/) with friends. It's fun! [Into the Aether](https://intothecast.online/) coined (or related from someone else?) the term "friend slop" for this genre and I think it's a good descriptor. There's not a ton of meat on the bone here but it's a good way to spend an hour or two on Discord.

# What I'm up to
- Enjoying Fantasy Football season again, and this year experimenting with using Claude as my team manager copilot. Fun but still requires way too much manual work to upload data each week, keep contexts manageable, etc. We still have so far to go in terms of building frameworks and tools for these models to use to be effective in everyday workflows (hmm is there an AI wrapper app here?).
