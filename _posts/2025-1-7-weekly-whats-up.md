# What I'm reading
- [The Online Sports Gambling Experiment has Failed](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tHiB8jLocbPLagYDZ/the-online-sports-gambling-experiment-has-failed). From the start my intuition with this stuff has been "We can't compete, this shouldn't be legal".
	- Some disturbing numbers from recent studies:
		- "First, credit scores, a summary metric of overall creditworthiness, decrease by modest but statistically significant amounts (~1%). We also test for evidence of pre-trends between treated/control states and find none. … Second, several measures of excessive debt increase substantially. We find a roughly 28% increase in bankruptcies and an 8% increase in debt transferred to debt collectors"
		- "The negative effects on investment are large relative to the sample mean. The average household invests about $360 a quarter so a $50 decrease in investment is a loss of 14%"
		- [Here’s a third paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4938642), showing that sports betting increases domestic violence.
	- If this is going to work, it needs strong friction barriers to entry (drive to a bar!) and a more neutral market structure i.e. the actual stock market. You can't have these big companies choosing losers and kicking off winners!

# What I'm watching
- Writing this update as I'm watching the first [TGL](https://tglgolf.com/) matchup. It's... fine? The shot clock is great, the banter isn't too cringe. If this is going to succeed they need to get wild with the holes. Take notes from [Club TFE's design challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlbxEFDs2-8)!

# What I'm writing
- I wrote up [[2025-1-5 My favorite video games of 2024]].
