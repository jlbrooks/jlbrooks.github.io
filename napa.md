# Where to stay
Napa is not cheap to stay in, and I think that it's worth trying to stay close to downtown if you're visiting. The downtown core is very small and walkable, with lots of good food and drink options.

- If you like being in the heart of things, walking to food, and don't mind spending a bit more money, then the [Archer Hotel](https://archerhotel.com/napa),  [Andaz](https://www.hyatt.com/andaz/apcrn-andaz-napa), or the [Napa River Inn](https://www.napariverinn.com/) are all good options. 
	- The BnBs just south of downtown are also a great location ([The George](https://www.thegeorgenapa.com/), [Cedar Gables Inn](https://www.cedargablesinn.com/), etc.)
- If you don't mind being a bit further away (~1 mile walk to downtown) then the [Discovery Inn](https://www.napadiscoveryinn.com/), [Hawthorn Suites](https://www.napavalleyinns.com/), or [Hampton Inn and Suites](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/apcighx-hampton-suites-napa/) are all fine.

# Food
All of our favorites. So much good food in Napa, so just because something is not on this list doesn't mean it's not worth visiting.

Mexican:
- [Taqueria Maria](https://www.taqueriamaria.com/) is very good for the price.
- [Los Agaves](https://losagavesnapa.com/) is a bit more upscale, nice place for dinner.

Pub food:
- [Napa Palisades](https://napapalisades.com/)
- [Gotts](https://www.gotts.com/), of course!

Seafood:
- [Scala](https://www.scalaosteria.com/)
- [Hog island](https://hogislandoysters.com/) at the Oxbow.

Italian:
- [Azzurro](http://www.azzurropizzeria.com/) for Pizza
- [Pasta Prego](https://maps.app.goo.gl/QFMNi6bsEvhn9jhBA)
- [Don Giovanni](https://www.bistrodongiovanni.com/) - a bit outside of town

Finer dining:
- [Torc](https://www.torcnapa.com/) 
- [Enclos](https://enclos-sonoma.com/) up in Sonoma. Fixed course fine dining, pricey but worth it for a special occasion. Likely on their way to a Michelin Star.

Other:
- [Small World](https://www.smallworldrestaurant.com/) for great Mediterranean
- [Kitchen Door](https://www.kitchendoornapa.com/) has a rotating menu, always good stuff.
- [Contimo](https://www.contimonapa.com/) relatively new as of 2025, great sandwiches.
- [Stateline Smokehouse](https://www.stateline-road.com/) has fantastic BBQ
- [Moro](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CgTUNJzVihQA7ssZ9) at the Oxbow. Get the beef or lamb pita, incredible.

Up valley:
- [Ray Rays tacos](https://rayrays.com/)
- [Bistro Jeanty](https://bistrojeanty.com/) finer dining, French food.

# Non-wine drinks
There are some great breweries in town:
- [Fieldwork](https://fieldworkbrewing.com/napa/) at the Oxbow. You can bring food in, lots of great options at the Oxbow.
- [Armistice Brewing](https://www.armisticebrewing.com/). As of May 2025 they have a counter serving [Butter's Burgers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/4oLnTN28PeYc5xXf6) - smash burgers that are to die for.

Spirits:
- [Napa Distillery](https://www.napadistillery.com/) makes good stuff - lots of brandies, some interesting cordials and pre-made cocktails. Their main location is closed after a fire (opening again Fall 2025) but they have two locations in town: The [Club Room](https://www.napadistillery.com/the-club-room) and [Arbaretum](https://www.napadistillery.com/the-arbaretum). Recommend the Club Room for a tasting experience and Arbaretum if you just want a cocktail.
- [The Bitter Bar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JWWpH6XAsNWhghtXA) and [The Fink](https://maps.app.goo.gl/18FTarLRFavr9pXx9) are good spots for late night drinks.

Night life:
- [Bilco's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Q5Lnuytg4kJ9sHzp8) is the place to be for townies. Pool hall and a big beer list, usually crowded on the weekends.
- [Downtown Joe's](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kBXrR6ThAtn3McLF8) is another townie bar, open late.
- The [Andaz hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p2e54no4Lke3Jx1BA) has a bar/restaurant on the roof.

# Wine tasting
We don't get out a ton to taste, but these are our favorites:
- [ZD wines](https://www.zdwines.com/) a little bit up valley, but probably our favorite Napa wine. 
- [Bouchaine](https://maps.app.goo.gl/phYJq5qvTCE3rDcM6) out in Carneros has a lovely outdoor tasting area.
- [Sleeping Giant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/KQdGSVb5Xd2d7fb98), also out in Carneros.
- [Schramsberg](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vzS2KhuS8Nagbufg9) for sparkling wine. Cool to tour the caves, and Kaitlin's parents' grapes are in the J Schram.

Some options in town:
- [No Love Lost](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Je8Vdj6YMusW9d7K7) great wine at a very reasonable price.
- [Azur wines](https://maps.app.goo.gl/UyEbBx2LVAexrb5f9).
- [Mia Carta](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7JrMAD4QgbiNxaQ57) is a fun tasting room that offers wine from ~6-10 very small producers.

# Activities
- Mentioned a couple of times above, but the [Oxbow public market](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YjoSFevBN7A5CfjK8) is worth a visit. Lots of good food, a sweet shop, a book shop, and a small grocery. Nice place to get lunch and hang out.
- The [Sonoma central plaza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qKZPQVRpdycgUH6D9) is lovely. Lots of shops and restaurants lining the square and open containers are allowed - great spot for a picnic with a bottle of wine. On Tuesday nights in the summer there is a [farmers market with live music](https://www.sonomacity.org/sonomas-market/).

There's good hiking around:
- [Skyline park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/qpKm5VUzwGTAP3tv8) at the southeast end of town. Can put together anywhere from 3-8 mile loop, great views of town and south to the bay. Recommend the Skyline trail for the best views
- Lake Hennessey from [Moore creek park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7PTTrKNqi2cLNPDt9). Can either hike up the creek and [loop up to the ridge](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/valentine-vista-trail) or if you're up for something longer head down to [the bluff above the lake](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/conn-peak-via-alta-hennessey-and-shoreline-loop?u=i&sh=veblwm).
- For something flatter, [Wetlands park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j6TemwFt3L2D2sa98) down in American Canyon has a nice loop right next to the water.
